# Copenhagen / CPH

One Day in Copenhagen

- I dream of the cardamom croissant at Hart Bageri (Juno is good but Hart is better, and there are many more Hart locations).
- I also dream of the nduja scrambled eggs at Studio x Kitchen.
- You can't go wrong with coffee at Prolog's several locations or Coffee Collective.
- Barr is a quintessentially Copenhagen restaurant, as is Kodbyens Fiskebar; both are worth trying.
- Bird is one of my favorite cocktail bars anywhere; go alone and chat with the bartenders or with friends and listen to the record selection.
- If you, like me, need non-European food after a few meals, Hija de Sanchez makes a passable al pastor taco and Slurp has surprisingly solid ramen.
- For some of the coolest ceramics and glassware you can find, hit up Studio Arhoj.
- Nearby, Norse Projects has three stores with top-tier clothing and accessories; all are worth a visit and stock different things.
- If you have women in your life, get them something cool from Ganni (hot tip: save a bit by hitting the clearance store Ganni Postmodern).
