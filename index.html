	<h2>Hi! I'm Nishant.</h2>
	<p>
	I'm a research intern at Uber ATG, looking into simulation for self-driving vehicles. I used to work on simulation for automated trucks at <a href="http://ikerobotics.com">Ike</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I went to Berkeley, where I studied electrical engineering and computer science, taught a <a href="http://data8.org">data science course</a> that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-berkeley-its-big-data-on-campus-1541066401">Wall Street Journal wrote about</a>, and <a href="http://bayen.berkeley.edu">researched</a> <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/2018/10/turning-cars-robot-traffic-managers">traffic-mitigating strategies</a> for autonomous vehicles and intelligent infrastructure.
	</p>
	<p>
	I was part of the team that developed <a href="http://flow-project.github.io">Flow</a>, a framework inferfacing the microscopic vehicle simulator SUMO with the deep reinforcement libraries RLlib and rllab. Flow enables the design and analysis of traffic scenarios as well as the training of agents using deep RL. <a href="https://easychair.org/publications/open/FBQq">Here</a> <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v87/vinitsky18a/vinitsky18a.pdf">are</a> <a href="itsc_cistar_paper.pdf">some</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1lT6YT4hm">things</a> I've worked on. I also like to bake, read, and bike.
